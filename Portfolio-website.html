                    <h2> About</h2>
                    <p> My name is Hudabia Ahmad and I'm currently working to change my career from a high school teacher to a software developer. I hope to work with you in the future as your first choice as a front-end developer. </p>
                   
                    <p> I am currently learning <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> thorugh <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a> courses and working to create this website using a coding book that my younger brother didn't want anymore. He, by the way, never attempted or read through it. Hopefully, seeing how how much I have accomplished through this website will help young students, like my brother, become interested and try it on their own. Thank you CoderDojo for their book <a href="http://www.scholastic.com/coder-dojo/coderdojo-nano-build-your-own-website-create-with-code/index.html" target="_blank"><i>Create with code - Build your own website.</i></a>  Recently, my father also introduced me to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me?trk=nav_neptune_learning&u=56969921" target="_blank">LinkedIn Learning</a> and the many resources they offer. Recently, I;ve been practiceing the exercises through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. Check in frequently to see what new skills I've learned as I continue to update this portfolio website.</p>
